  "introduction": "In this laboratory, students will get to explore and learn various concepts regarding analog electrical signals, networks and measurement of various electrical components. The experiments are developed on open source web-based platforms, so that the student doesn't need to download or install any third-party application. Each experiment is designed in such a way that, the student first gets to learn the theories well and then perform the experiment to enhance their knowledge.",
